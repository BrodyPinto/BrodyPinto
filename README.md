### Hello there!

I am currently junior double-majoring in Data Science 💻  and Biology 🧬 at St. Lawrence University in Canton, NY.

I am also minoring in Mathematics 🧮 and have a particular interest in statistical theory involving time series analysis with financial applications. I am also on the tennis team at St. Lawrence University, making the most of my liberal arts university experience as a full-time student-athlete.
